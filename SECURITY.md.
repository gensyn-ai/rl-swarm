# Security Policy

## Supported versions

RL Swarm is under active development. In practice, only the latest code on the `main` branch is supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue in RL Swarm:

- Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue describing the details.
- Instead, use the **“Report a vulnerability”** button in the **Security** tab of this repository to submit a private report.
- Include as much detail as possible:
  - steps to reproduce
  - expected vs. actual behaviour
  - environment (OS, Python version, CPU/GPU)
  - relevant logs or minimal configuration snippets

The maintainers will review your report, reach out if they need more information, and coordinate a fix and disclosure if necessary.
