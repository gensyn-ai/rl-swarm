## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in RL Swarm:

- Do not open a public GitHub issue.
- Use the "Report a vulnerability" flow in the **Security** tab of this repository, or
- Contact the maintainers via the official channels listed at https://docs.gensyn.ai.

Please include enough detail (environment, steps to reproduce, logs) so the issue can be investigated and fixed safely.
